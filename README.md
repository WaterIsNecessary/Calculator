# Calculator

A web based calculator. This calculator will carry out the basic operations
of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The calculator will carry out said operations on two numbers at a time. Due to
this the calculator at present will not support BODMAS.

Both operands and functionality will be extended upon after first 
implementations.

## To do list:

- Implement a negative/positive button such that current inputted numbers can be
toggled to be positive or negative. This allows the input of negative numbers
for calculations by the calculator.

- Implement keyboard support.
